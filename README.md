# Claude Usage Widget

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demo.gif" width="340" alt="Demo: the widget responding to a usage tick. The Current session bar slides up from 42% to 91%, the dot turns red and pulses, and a desktop notification fires at the critical threshold." />
</p>

**An always-on-top floating widget that shows your claude.ai plan usage in real time, on Windows.** Built specifically around the OAuth token Claude Code already keeps on your machine, so it cannot be broken by Cloudflare changes that take down cookie-scraping trackers.

➡ **[Download the latest portable .exe](../../releases/latest)** — ~88 MB, single file, no install. Tested on Windows 11.

> First-launch note: the EXE is unsigned (we have applied for free open-source code signing through the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) — once accepted, future releases will be signed by SignPath Foundation's certificate at no cost). SmartScreen will say "Windows protected your PC." Click **More info → Run anyway**. One-time click per machine.

> **If your antivirus calls it `Trojan:Win32/Wacatac` or similar:** this is a known false positive that hits every unsigned Electron app (Discord, VS Code, Notion all had it before they signed their builds). The `!ml` suffix on the detection name means it came from Windows Defender's machine-learning heuristic, not a real signature match. To verify the file you have is identical to what I published:
> ```powershell
> Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\ClaudeUsageWidget-*.exe
> ```
> and compare against `SHA256SUMS.txt` on the [release page](../../releases/latest). If the hash matches you have the canonical build. The v0.2.17 release binary has already been independently scanned:
>
> - **Portable EXE** (`ClaudeUsageWidget-0.2.17-portable.exe`): [0 / 64 engines detected as malicious](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/27fa0046cef6ba50ee670116a067069aaba1513480de4f6fc1b50201b0c3d36f)
> - **Installer EXE** (`ClaudeUsageWidget-0.2.17-setup.exe`): [0 / 68 engines detected as malicious](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/de62ec183f7451db66c0f084591e136984b39d19dfabb278113cfba46b1836c3)
>
> Every signature-based engine on VirusTotal — including Microsoft's own — comes back clean. The Wacatac flag on real Windows machines comes entirely from Defender's cloud-delivered ML model (the `!ml` suffix), which doesn't run on VirusTotal's static scans. To work around it on your machine: Defender → **Virus & threat protection** → **Protection history** → restore + allow. Permanent fix (code signing via SignPath Foundation) is in flight — once it lands, this section goes away.

## Changes in this fork

- Hides the internal `nimbus_quill` placeholder key from the widget display

## What it shows

The same bars as **Settings → Usage** on claude.ai, plus things they don't:

- Current session (5-hour rolling window)
- Weekly · all models / Sonnet / Opus / Cowork / **Fable** / any other model-scoped weekly limit Anthropic ships — the widget picks these up automatically from the API's new scoped-limit shape and labels them "Weekly · &lt;model&gt;" in whichever of the 13 UI languages you're using
- Extra usage credits if your plan has a credit pool — with the dollar amount used and the monthly cap (e.g. `$225 of $5,000 used`), not just the percentage
- Reset countdowns per limit
- A **pace marker** on each bar — a vertical line that turns red when you're burning faster than the timer
- An optional 7-day SVG history graph for any limit you pick
- Threshold notifications and shell hooks that fire when a limit resets
- A **pill / minimal mode** that collapses the widget to a tiny ~156×44 capsule showing just the worst-utilized limit %, ideal for non-developers who want ambient awareness without giving up screen real estate
- **Claw'd**, an animated Clawd crab mascot that reacts to your usage state — happy at low use, thinking at warn, mind-blown at critical, sleeping when rate-limited, celebrating when a quota resets, waving when you click. Pet artwork by [@abderrahimghazali](https://github.com/abderrahimghazali/clawd-pet) (MIT).
- **In-app update check** — once a day the widget pings GitHub Releases and surfaces a small `↑ v0.2.X` link in the footer when a newer build is out, so you never run a stale version without knowing
- **13-language UI** — English (default), Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Russian, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Indonesian. Switch in Settings → Language. See [Translations](#translations) below for credits and how to refine machine-assisted languages.

## How it's different

> **TL;DR.** It's the only Windows widget that combines the Cloudflare-immune OAuth auth path with an always-on-top floating UX, a 7-day history graph, multiple tray icon styles, per-quota reset hooks, and a snapshot-tested parser.

Built from the lessons learned across all of the above. Borrowed patterns:

| Pattern | From |
|---|---|
| OAuth Bearer from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` | jens-duttke/usage-monitor-for-claude |
| Adaptive polling tiers + 10 s manual-refresh debounce | jens-duttke + f-is-h/Usage4Claude |

| Re-read credentials on 401 (picks up token refreshes from other Claude Code sessions) | this project |
| Always-on-top re-assertion every 30 s | niccolo-sabato/claude-usage-widget |
| "Essential" compact layout | niccolo-sabato |
| Light/Dark/System theming, draggable header, circular countdowns | SlavomirDurej/claude-usage-widget |
| Configurable warn/critical thresholds + native notifications | eddmann/ClaudeMeter |
| Pace marker / burn-rate indicator | jens-duttke + eddmann |
| `on_reset_command` shell hook per quota | jens-duttke |
| Multiple tray icon styles | eddmann/ClaudeMeter |

What we explicitly **avoided**:

- DPAPI Chrome cookie SQLite reads (thanoban) — breaks on every Chrome key rotation.
- Hitting `claude.ai` directly from Node — Cloudflare blocks the runtime's TLS fingerprint.
- Hardcoding three quota types — the OAuth endpoint returns a dynamic set; we iterate.

## Install

You need [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed and logged in either way, because the widget reads the OAuth token it maintains at `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.

### Windows — download the EXE

1. Download the latest **portable .exe** from [Releases](../../releases/latest).
2. Double-click it. SmartScreen → **More info → Run anyway**.
3. Right-click the tray icon for options, or click the cog inside the widget for the full settings panel.

### Linux — download the AppImage (tester build)

1. Download the latest **`ClaudeUsageWidget-X.Y.Z-x86_64.AppImage`** from [Releases](../../releases/latest).
2. `chmod +x ClaudeUsageWidget-*.AppImage` then double-click it (or run it from a terminal).
3. Right-click the tray icon for options, or click the cog inside the widget for the full settings panel.

Linux is a **first tester build** — everything should work but a couple of Windows-flavored strings still leak through (e.g. the "Start with Windows" toggle label). Report issues on the tracker.

### macOS, or anyone who'd rather build from source

You already have the perfect tool to set this up: your own Claude Code. Paste the prompt below into a Claude Code session and let it handle the install. Works on macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Linux, and Windows.

````
Set up the Claude Usage Widget from https://github.com/projectvelox/claude-usage-widget on this machine.

1. Clone the repo into ~/Applications/claude-usage-widget (create the parent
   directory if needed; on Linux feel free to use ~/.local/share instead).
2. Run `npm install` in that directory.
3. Run `npm start` and confirm the floating widget appears in a corner of my
   screen. If it does, leave it running.
4. If I ask for a redistributable binary, run `npm run build:mac` (macOS),
   `npm run build:linux` (Linux), or `npm run build` (Windows) and tell me
   the path of the artifact under dist/.

If Node 18+ is not installed, install it via Homebrew (macOS) or my system
package manager (Linux) after asking permission. Do not modify shell rc
files. The widget reads ~/.claude/.credentials.json, so once it launches
it should start showing live usage within ~60 seconds.
````

After the first run, you can use whichever pattern you prefer for re-launching:

- macOS: double-click the built `.app` (inside the `.dmg`), or `npm start` from the cloned dir.
- Linux: run the `.AppImage`, or `npm start` from the cloned dir.
- Windows: double-click the portable `.exe`, or `npm start` from the cloned dir.

To make it auto-launch with your OS: open the widget, click the settings cog → **Startup → Start with [OS]**.

### For developers

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/projectvelox/claude-usage-widget
cd claude-usage-widget
npm install
npm start
```

**Branch model.** `main` is the production branch — every tag-push there cuts a public release. `dev` is the working branch where day-to-day commits land. Pushing to `dev` runs the full test suite and, if green, opens (or updates) a single "Promote dev → main" PR. Merging that PR is the only path code takes into production.

```powershell
git checkout dev                       # work here
# edit, commit
git push origin dev                    # CI runs tests, opens promote PR if green

# when you're ready to release:
gh pr merge <PR#> --merge              # promote dev → main
git checkout main; git pull
npm version patch                      # bumps + tests + tags + pushes; CI builds + publishes
```

`npm version` runs `npm test` before bumping (preversion hook) and `git push --follow-tags` after (postversion hook), so a single command takes you from "I have a fix on main" to "release is live."

```powershell
npm test                 # parser snapshot tests + updater semver tests + display geometry tests
npm run icons            # regenerate the tray + window icons
npm run demo-gif         # regenerate assets/demo.gif (main demo)
npm run pill-gif         # regenerate assets/demo-pill.gif (minimal mode demo)
npm run layouts-png      # regenerate assets/layouts.png (layout comparison)
npm run trays-png        # regenerate assets/trays.png (tray icon styles)
npm run themes-png       # regenerate assets/themes.png (dark vs light)
npm run thresholds-png   # regenerate assets/thresholds.png (OK / warn / critical)
npm run history-png      # regenerate assets/history.png (7-day graph showcase)
npm run settings-png     # regenerate assets/settings.png (full settings panel)
npm run mascot-preview   # regenerate assets/claw-d.png + per-mood capture frames
npm run og-image         # regenerate the 1280x640 social-preview PNG
npm run build            # portable EXE in dist/
npm run build:installer  # NSIS one-click installer in dist/
```

## Make it yours

The widget is built to disappear into your workflow. Almost every part of how it looks, where it sits, and when it interrupts you is configurable from the settings cog — no config-file editing required.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/settings.png" width="720" alt="The full settings panel: Layout, Look, Tray icon, History graph, Thresholds, Notifications, Reset hooks, Startup, and About — every option visible on one screen." />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/layouts.png" width="640" alt="Four layout options side by side: Expanded (full bars + countdowns), Compact (tighter spacing), Essential (bars only, no chrome), and Minimal (pill showing worst limit only)." />
</p>

### Layout

Four density modes, swap any time from the header chevron or settings:

- **Expanded** — the full experience: header, bars, reset countdowns, pace markers, optional history graph.
- **Compact** — header + bars, countdowns hidden. Saves vertical space.
- **Essential** — tightest spacing, footer hidden, smaller fonts. (Pair with the "Hide header" toggle if you want bars-only with no chrome at all.)
- **Minimal (pill)** — single capsule showing the worst-utilized limit's % and severity color. ~156×44 px. Click the chevron inside the pill to expand back. Designed for **non-developers who want ambient awareness without giving up screen real estate**.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="assets/demo-pill.gif" width="320" alt="Pill mode animating from 30% (green) up through 78% (yellow warn) to 91% (red critical), then resetting." />
  </p>

Plus: always-on-top, optional click-through (let clicks pass through the widget), show/hide header, pace marker, stale badge, reset countdown toggle.

### Look

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/themes.png" width="640" alt="The widget rendered in Dark and Light themes side by side, showing the same data with different surface colors." />
</p>

- **Theme:** System / Dark / Light, follows OS by default.
- **Accent color:** pick any hex — recolors the bars, dots, and gauge.
- **Opacity:** 40 – 100 % so the widget can sit unobtrusively over other windows.
- **Corner radius:** 0 – 28 px (sharp corners to fully rounded).
- **Font scale:** 85 – 160 %, plus optional custom font family.
- **Background blur:** toggle the glass-blur backdrop on systems where it's expensive.

### Tray icon

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/trays.png" width="720" alt="Five tray icon styles side by side: Bars (three stacked bars), Battery (fill level), Gauge (circular progress), Minimal (solid dot), and Dynamic (gauge tinted by live severity)." />
</p>

Five styles, all redraw live as your usage changes:

- **Bars** — three stacked bars, abstract but on-brand.
- **Battery** — fill level mirrors your worst utilization, just like a phone battery.
- **Gauge** — circular progress arc.
- **Minimal** — solid colored dot, severity-tinted.
- **Dynamic** — picks the right representation automatically and colors it by the live worst-limit severity.

### History graph

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/history.png" width="360" alt="The widget with the 7-day history graph expanded under the weekly bar: a smooth SVG sparkline shaded underneath, with the current % shown beside the series label." />
</p>

Toggle on/off. Pick any single limit to plot (all-models, Sonnet, Opus, session, or extra) — 7 days of samples, drawn as a smooth SVG sparkline inside the widget body.

### Claw'd, the resident crab

Claw'd is animated using pet artwork from [`clawd-pet`](https://github.com/abderrahimghazali/clawd-pet) by [@abderrahimghazali](https://github.com/abderrahimghazali) (MIT). Ten SVGs ship in [`renderer/pets/`](renderer/pets/) — each pet carries its own CSS animation baked into the SVG, and the widget wraps the current pet in a walk cycle so he actually paces the bottom strip.

#### The pet collection

**Ambient walking pets** — he paces the widget bottom while showing these.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="renderer/pets/clawd-happy.svg" width="88" alt="happy" /><br /><b>happy</b><br /><sub>worst limit &lt; 75%</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="renderer/pets/clawd-working-thinking.svg" width="88" alt="thinking" /><br /><b>thinking</b><br /><sub>75%–90%</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="renderer/pets/clawd-mindblown.svg" width="88" alt="mind-blown" /><br /><b>mind-blown</b><br /><sub>≥ 90%</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Paused / error pets** — he parks and looks at you when there's something to notice.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="renderer/pets/clawd-sleeping.svg" width="88" alt="sleeping" /><br /><b>sleeping</b><br /><sub>rate-limited ≥ 2 min</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="renderer/pets/clawd-shrug.svg" width="88" alt="shrug" /><br /><b>shrug</b><br /><sub>no Claude Code login</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="renderer/pets/clawd-401.svg" width="88" alt="401" /><br /><b>401</b><br /><sub>OAuth token expired</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="renderer/pets/clawd-disconnected.svg" width="88" alt="disconnected" /><br /><b>disconnected</b><br /><sub>network / HTTP error</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Transient event pets** — he flashes these for a few seconds when something happens.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="renderer/pets/clawd-celebrating.svg" width="88" alt="celebrating" /><br /><b>celebrating</b><br /><sub>quota reset (3s flash)</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="renderer/pets/clawd-waving.svg" width="88" alt="waving" /><br /><b>waving</b><br /><sub>click on the mascot (1.5s flash)</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Interactions

- **Click him while he's sleeping** and you get a random grumpy speech bubble (`"5 more minutes…"`, `"Hmph."`, `"Rude."`, etc.) instead of a wave. Localized in all 13 UI languages.
- **Click him any other time** and he waves for 1.5 seconds before going back to his usual pacing.
- **Watch him celebrate** when a quota window resets — he does a 3-second victory dance.

Toggle him on/off in **Settings → Layout → "Show Claw'd"**. Hidden automatically in pill and essential layouts where there's no room. To swap in a different pet, drop the SVG in [`renderer/pets/`](renderer/pets/) and edit the `MOOD_PET` / `ERROR_PET` map at the top of [`renderer/widget.js`](renderer/widget.js) — [`clawd-pet`](https://github.com/abderrahimghazali/clawd-pet) has **140+** to pick from.

### Thresholds & notifications

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/thresholds.png" width="720" alt="The same widget rendered at three severity states side by side: OK (green bar + dot) at 32%, Warn (yellow) at 78%, and Critical (red) at 91% with a pulsing dot." />
</p>

- **Warn %** and **Critical %** (defaults: 75 / 90) — controls when bars change color and when notifications fire.
- **Per-state colors** for OK / warn / critical — fully customizable.
- **Native desktop notifications** at warn level (optional) and critical level (on by default).

### Reset hooks (power-user)

Run any shell command when a specific quota window rolls over. The command gets these env vars:

- `CLAUDE_RESET_ID` — which limit reset (e.g., `seven_day_sonnet`)
- `CLAUDE_RESET_LABEL` — the human-readable label
- `CLAUDE_RESET_AT` — the new reset timestamp

Useful for: piping a notification to Slack, triggering a "fresh start" script, kicking off a batch job that was waiting on quota.

### Startup

- **Start with Windows** — registers the widget as a login item.
- **Open hidden** — launch straight to the system tray, no widget popup on boot.

---

Config persists to `%APPDATA%\claude-usage-widget\config.json`; history samples to `%APPDATA%\claude-usage-widget\history.json`.

## Auth — and what we don't touch

The widget reads the OAuth access token that Claude Code already maintains. There is no separate login, no browser cookie scraping, no Cloudflare hassle.

If the token expires:

1. The widget shows an `auth` badge.
2. On the next poll, it re-reads the credentials file. If Claude Code (or another concurrent Claude session) has refreshed the token, the new value is used immediately.
3. If the token is truly expired, run `claude` in a terminal to refresh, and the widget catches up on the next poll.

The token is sent only to `https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` — Anthropic's official endpoint, and nothing else. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full statement.

## Roadmap

- Multi-account / multi-org switcher (cross-cutting top demand)
- Codex usage alongside Claude (Usage4Claude has this, we want it)
- Burn-down projection line on the history graph ("at this rate, you hit 100% by Thu 6 pm")
- Mac and Linux builds in the same CI workflow
- Signed Windows binary via [SignPath OSS](https://signpath.io/)
- `winget install` distribution

See [open issues](../../issues) for the current state.

## Translations

The widget ships with 13 languages. English is canonical and hand-written; **Portuguese (Brazil)** was contributed by [@Ian03](https://github.com/Ian03/claude-usage-widget), whose fork seeded the i18n architecture and the first translation. The remaining 11 (Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Russian, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Indonesian) are **machine-assisted** — marked with a `*` in the language picker — and will benefit from native-speaker refinement.

If something reads awkwardly in your language:

1. Open [`locales/<your-lang>.json`](locales/) and edit the strings you want to improve.
2. Drop `_meta.machineTranslated` to `false` once you (or another native speaker) have reviewed the whole file.
3. Open a PR. The test suite enforces schema parity (every locale must have every key in `en.json`), so missing keys will fail CI before review.

Want to add a language that isn't here? Copy `en.json` to `locales/<your-code>.json`, set `_meta` accordingly, translate, and open a PR.

## Changelog

[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) is auto-regenerated from git history on every push to `main` by [`.github/workflows/changelog.yml`](.github/workflows/changelog.yml). Per-release notes (with download links and the SmartScreen blurb) live on the [Releases page](../../releases).
